1>   What is your understanding of blockchain ?
Ans>  Blockchain is a technology where security, transparency and decentralization is ensured. Data is embedded in the form of blocks and is secured in proper manner.
2>   What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve ?
Ans>  Core problem is third party involvement is the problem. Blockchain technology do verification without being dependent on third party. So data cannot be altered or deleted.
3> What are the few features which blockchain will give you ?
Ans>  NO hacking 
Huge security boost
Verification
Data transparency
Decentralized
4> What all things does a block contain?
Ans> A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
5>How is the verifiabilty of blockchain has been attained?
Ans>Blockchains are made of blocks of code joined together and is essentially a process based on consensus between transacting parties. 
The blockchain network has many nodes of such continuous blockchains.
